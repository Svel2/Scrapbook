## 🎉 Surprise Experience Rules

### The AI MUST:
- Reveal content progressively
- Provide clear triggers to open surprises
- Maintain curiosity and emotional build-up

### The AI MUST NOT:
- Show all surprise content at once
- Reveal gifts at the beginning
- Use default browser `alert()` for important moments
- Expose surprise details in metadata (title, description, OG tags)

## ⚙️ Engineering Rules

- Use clean and strict TypeScript
- Apply Tailwind CSS utility-first approach
- Build reusable components
- Avoid over-engineering
- Ensure readable and scalable code

Example of preferred code style:

```tsx
<button
  className="rounded-xl bg-pink-400 px-6 py-3 text-white
             hover:bg-pink-500 transition"
>
  Open the Gift 🎁
</button>
